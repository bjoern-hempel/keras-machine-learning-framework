# GPU vs CPU

Performance comparison based on the Kaggle floral data set training: https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition This picture set consists of 5 classes with about 4350 training pictures.

The training time includes 10 training epochs, whereby InceptionV3 was used as a transfer learning model. The times were determined with the following standard command:

```bash
(keras-gpu) C:\Users> ml train --data-path=./Data/raw/flowers --model-file=./Data/inceptionv3-trained.h5

Using TensorFlow backend.
