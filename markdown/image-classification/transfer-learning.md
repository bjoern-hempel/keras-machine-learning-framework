## Transfer learning models

The data set ./data/raw/flowers is based on Kaggle's floral data set: https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition. Calculated were 20 epochs on a GTX 1060 from Nvidia:

| Model             | Accuracy | Time               | Factor | Efficiency<sup>*</sup> |
|-------------------|----------|--------------------|--------|------------------------|
| InceptionResNetV2 | 89,71%   |  753.7s 00:12:33.7 |  1.36x | 0.66                   |
| InceptionV3       | 91,14%   |  553.8s 00:09:13.8 |  1.00x | 0.91                   |
| ResNet50          | 97,75%   | 1638.6s 00:27:18.6 |  2,96x | 0,33                   |
| VGG19             | 97,99%   |  721.5s 00:12:01.5 |  1.30x | 0,75                   |
