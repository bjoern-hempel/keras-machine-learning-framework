# Nine Points Demo

Imagine the following situation. We have given the following coordinates:

Points around the x-values 1 and 0 as well as the y-values also around 1 and 0 should result in 1. Only the point [0.5, 0.5] should give 0:

This could simply be implemented algorithmically.

## Deductive learning approach

For example:

```
#toBeDone
```

This should work. But what happens when there are changes. E.g. that [0, 0] should also result in 0? It needs a programmer who changes the above source code and thinks about the problem! Wouldn't it make more sense if it also worked automatically?
